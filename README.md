# DemeoMods
New Rulesets:
=============
- Demeo Revolutions
- Demeo Revolutions (EASY)
- Demeo Revolutions (HARD)
- Demeo Revolutions (LEGENDARY)
- Demeo Revolutions (PROGRESSIVE)

General Mod changes
===================
- If you die or are disconnected you can rejoin with a new character. To continue the mod/ruleset just have everyone else leave the room and rejoin so you become the game host again. On their turn everyone else will gain 1 round of invulnerability to protect them from damage if/when enemies attack them and to make up for the lost turn!
- Colorized text display of advanced stats when clicking/grabbing player pieces. In PROGRESSIVE ruleset this displays character levels, current perks, and what perks they get at the next level. Works when NOT hosting games also!

### `About the new Progressive ruleset`
You will **NOT** ***start*** with most of the normal [Demeo Revolutions abilities and perks](https://github.com/TheGrayAlien/DemeoMods/blob/DemeoRevolutions/README.md#demeo-revolutions-class-changes). Instead, you will gain them as you `LEVEL UP` by filling the card mana meter. You start with 1 knockdown instead of 3. Gaining a level heals the party for 2 (if hurt) and will revive downed party members. You will still gain cards when filling the card meter. Discarding cards will only give 25% of the amount indicated (to avoid exploiting levels). If you die and return to pick another character you will start at level 1 again. Party members can see their current levels indicated by a new permanent buff over their heads. Enemy difficulty increases on each new floor.

***`Level 1`*** - Critical hits on your FINAL action function as in normal Demeo Revolutions except the Guardian only gains 1 Action Point instead of 2 (until level 3)

***`Level 2`*** - Gain 1 permanent replenishable ability. Pull, Stealth, Arrow, Zap, Lightning Bolt, Courage Shanty, Feral Charge, and Grapple now cost 0 Action Points

***`Level 3`*** - Gain 1 health and critical hits restore your 0 Action Cost replenishables and/or Action Points (depending on class) as in normal Demeo Revolutions

***`Level 4`*** - Gain 1 knockdown and critical hits also earns you 30 gold OR heal you for 1 if you're on the last floor

***`Level 5`*** - Gain 1 bonus & max bonus to a stat (Strength or Magic depending on class)

***`Level 6`*** - Gain 2 health

***`Level 7`*** - Gain 2 bonus & max bonus to Swiftness

***`Level 8`*** - Gain 1 knockdown and 1 extra Action Point per turn

***`Level 9`*** - Gain 3 health

***`Level 10`*** - Gain 2 bonus & max bonus to stat (Strength or Magic depending on class) AND a new permanent powerful ability that can only be used once every 6 turns


### `About the Extra Energy buff given by the Energy Potion`
When the Energy Potion card is used it will give each character 2 extra maximum health, a NEW ability that they can use 3 times total that will not cost any action points when used. There is no turn limit to the buff. The character using the Energy Potion will not get the ability until their NEXT turn. The buff counter will update at the start of your turn to let you know how many more charges are left. If you use all 3 charges then at the end of that turn you will lose the extra 2 maximum health and gain a Thorns debuff for 2 rounds.

**Guardian:**
- ***`Leap`*** Jumps a moderate distance. Landing causes 5 damage to each enemy within a 3x3 area.

**Barbarian:**
- ***`Vortex Storm`*** Drops 3 meteors over a large area that cause small vortexes that do 5 damage to each thing hit. This includes allies but not yourself. Does NOT hit lamps.

**Hunter:**
- ***`Lightning Bolt`*** Charges your bow with electricity that bounces and stuns enemies for 3 damage each. Triple damage on wet targets. CAN hit allies! Will be disabled on your turn if you are made wet.

**Assassin:**
- ***`Frets of Fire`*** Causes fire damage in a 7x7 area around you that does 3 damage to enemies. Does NOT break sneak. DOES hit lamps!

**Bard:**
- ***`Blink`*** Teleports to and attacks an enemy for 9 damage. This move also Weakens and Confuses the target.

**Warlock:**
- ***`Weakening Shout`*** Weakens, pushes, and hits enemies for 2 damage each in a straight line.

**Sorcerer:**
- ***`Rift Beam`*** Hits everything in a straight line for 5 damage. This includes friendlies.
