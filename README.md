About the Extra Energy buff given by the Energy Potion
======================================================

When the Energy Potion card is used it will give each character 2 extra maximum health, a NEW ability that they can use 3 times total that will not cost any action points when used. There is no turn limit to the buff. The character using the Energy Potion will not get the ability until their NEXT turn. The buff counter will update at the start of your turn to let you know how many more charges are left. If you use all 3 charges then at the end of that turn you will lose the extra 2 maximum health and gain a Thorns debuff for 2 rounds.

**Guardian:**
- Leap: Jumps a moderate distance. Landing causes 5 damage to each enemy within a 3x3 area.

**Assassin:**
